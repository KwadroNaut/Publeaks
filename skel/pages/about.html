        <div class="paragraph" data-translate>Publeaks is an online system which enables users to anonymously send material to media organisations. Documents with relevant information can be uploaded through the site. These pieces will be send to participating media organisations in a way that cannot be traced. Those who provide the information can choose themselves to which of the participating media organisations the documents should be send. If they indicate that they are open to it, then the receiving journalist will be able to contact them by using an untraceble code. (This is absolutely anonymous and is recommended, because it increases the chance on a succesvol investigation.) Journalists can then decide themselves to react, verify, investigate further, or publish.</div>
        <div class="paragraph" data-translate>This system reduced the barrier to make relevant information public and protects the sender.</div>
        <div class="paragraph" data-translate>The aim of Publeaks is to enable people with sensitive information to safely and anonymously contact the right persons in the most important press organisations.</div>
        <div class="paragraph" data-translate>The foundation has no access at all to the content of the documents nor any role in the relations between journalists and the provider of information. The foundation's goal is only to provide the infrastructure. Neither the foundation nor any other (legal) person have access to the data on the system: not to information about the sender and not about any documents that may have beens send.</div>
        <div class="paragraph" data-translate>The foundation has very limited financial means that are provided by the participated press organisations, funds and donations.</div>

          <li data-translate>To strengthen the capacity of the press to investigate and check power.</li>
          <li data-translate>To enable, facilitate and thereby stimulate the leaking of information to the press by persons who want to address suspected wrongdoings or abuse.</li>
          <li data-translate>This by making available a platform on which documents can be leaked to the press in an anonymous and safe manner.</li>
